## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This is the Jupyter notebook that can be run with
1. Anaconda distribution of Python
2. Python versions 3.*

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. Is there any peak time in the calendar that the price is higher?
2. Is the price different between areas/neighborhoods?
3. What are other features of the room can make the price different?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
